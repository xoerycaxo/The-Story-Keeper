## Description

The Story Keeper is a place to go to make your books more organized. You can store the books you have already read, books you are reading now and books you want to read next. You can use the search bar to look up books. And there is also a place where you can see what others think about that book while putting your own opinion down about the book you read as well. 

## Criteria

* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

* Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.

* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
